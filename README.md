# A simple, easy way to adjust your PC's volume 
Forget clicking on the tiny Windows icon they give you in your system tray 

(admit it... how many times did you accidently move to the 'Running Tasks'??)

It's very versatile, and can be controlled by arrow keys, mouse pointer, or mouse wheel.
Simply point to the knob (or anywhere on he app) and use your mouse wheel. It doesn't even have to have the focus.
Clicking on the volume indicator number (below the knob) mutes/unmutes.
The control remains 100% in sync with and updates/is updated by your master volume control.

Written in C#, feel free to use, contribute, hack, steal, and anything else!
